## Minimal Test Dataset

- Includes a **small, reproducible dataset** derived from real WGBS data ([ENA PRJNA730913](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA730913)), designed for fast prototyping and demonstration.
- All files are based on a subset of the original study, selected to minimize runtime and disk usage.
- Every file can be **fully regenerated** using the provided scripts.  
- No private or protected data is included â€” everything is public and open-access.
